The application start entry: index.html

Application structure:

--> index.html - react app is loaded in div with id of "root"

--> css/custom.css - my styles for the app, I used CSS grid functionality for some responsive magic

--> react_components/ - folder in which all of the react components are stored

--> react_components/app.js - root of the application where most of the logic is stored and then passed as props to other components

--> react_components/details.js - component for rendering star system details

--> react_components/listing.js - component for listing star systems with pagination

--> react_components/search.js - component which renders search bar on top
